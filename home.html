    <h1>GIS Assignments from GEOG 215: Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis</h1>
    <h2>Emma Holmes</h2>
    <h3>These GIS assignments were all completed using RStudio.</h3>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG215/Assignment2/Holmes_GEOG215_Assg2.html"><h3>Assignment 2</h3></a>
    <p>I made a line plot and another map while I practiced using R Markdown.</p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG215/Assignment3/Holmes_GEOG215_Assg3.html"><h3>Assignment 3</h3></a>
    <p>I queried the data, added geometry to a shapefile, and made multiple maps including a choropleth map.</p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG215/Assignment4/Code/GEOG215-data-presentation.html"><h3>Assignment 4</h3></a>
    <p>I created a table, a bar chart, and an interactive choropleth map.</p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG215/Assignment5/Code/Holmes_GEOG215_data_analysis.html"><h3>Assignment 5</h3></a>
    <p>I created a table with summary information about the data. Then I created three histograms with 
        varying binwidths to compare which worked best with the dataset. I did the same with three 
        choropleth maps, changing the style used.

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG215/Final/Holmes_GEOG215_Final.html"><h3>Final: Trees in London, UK</h3></a>
    <p>I found a dataset showing point locations of trees in London, UK and created a table with 
        summary statistics of the data. Then I created a barchart and an interactive choropleth map 
        showing the amount of trees in each borough. Finally, I ran an analysis on the data by using Moran's I 
        and LISA to see if the trees were more clustered or dispersed throughout London.
